        Hi! You found the EECS 485 Project 5 easter egg document! 
        
        Notice that this document is very different from the other ones -- all of the
        metadata is missing! All the other documents contain the same things in the header/footer 
        -- recall from Projects 1 and 2 that this is the perfect use case for templated HTML! 
        
        If all documents in the dataset contain some of the same words, those words will 
        have an inverse document frequency of 0 (Think about why!). This is problematic
        when we calculate the tf-idf for a query and can cause divide-by-zero errors.

        Adding a document that does not contain those words guarantees that there will be no words with IDF = 0.
        
        Happy Project 5!
